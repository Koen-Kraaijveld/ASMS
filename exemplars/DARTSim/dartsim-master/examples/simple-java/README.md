# simple-java Example Adaption Manager for DARTSim

This basic adaption manager provides an example of integrating an adaption
manager with DARTSim over the TCP interface, in this case, in the Java language.
Note that this adaption manager generally does not make good decisions, but
provides a basic example of integrating with DARTSim.

# Building simple-java

To build this example, change to the top-level directory in a terminal, for
example, `cd examples/simple-java`. Next, run the provided build shell script,
`./build.sh`. This script will download the required dependencies and compile
the example. The example can then be run by executing the run script with
`./run.sh`. However, note that before running it, DARTSim must be started.
See the `README.md` file for DARTSim for instruction for doing that.
